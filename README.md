## 📝 **Dev Note**

NomQuest is a personal project I created for fun. It's a platform designed to help me and others easily find food options available around my school campus (If I finish this project before I graduate xD). I built it because I often found it challenging to locate specific dishes or explore new food spots on campus, and I wanted to create a tool to make that process easier. While this app was primarily developed as a solution to my own problem, I hope others can enjoy and find it useful too.
